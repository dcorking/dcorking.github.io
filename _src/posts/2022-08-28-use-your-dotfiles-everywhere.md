A few years ago I saw an example of a git repository used to

worked on. So I made my [own dotfiles repo](),

configured the same way, your way, on every development machine you
use.

But I read recently that several more tools have been written, adding
even more automation to sharing your Unix home directory
preferences. I am tempted to try one of five new options in [the
comparison table shared by the chezmoi
project](https://www.chezmoi.io/comparison-table/)
