I saw from a recent Reddit thread that there are several static site
generators in Racket. They vary in the markup language that can be
used for pages, and the extent to which individual pages can have
programmatically generated custom content.

Interesting options include

- [racket darwin](https://github.com/pmatos/darwin) (a fork of the dormant frog project; not related to 'darwin', Apple's open source Mach kernel for operating systems)
- [pollen](https://docs.racket-lang.org/pollen/) (that was written to make web books such as Practical Typography)
- [racket stories](https://racket-stories.com/about)

Polyglot was another tool mentioned, but the links I followed were dead.
