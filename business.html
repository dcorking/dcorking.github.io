<!--#set var="title" value="business"--><!--#include virtual="head-menu.html"--><!-- include header title Business - David Corking -->

<p>
I am a director and principal consultant (and part owner) of a small UK
company, <a href="http://www.corking-project.co.uk/">Corking Project Limited</a>.
</p>

<p>
Founded in 2004 and incorporated in 2006, Corking Project is an independent
project management business.  We aim to deliver
excellence in IT and robotic system integration in sectors that include
manufacturing, distribution and telecommunications.
</p>

<h2>What do I bring to Corking Project Ltd?</h2>

<p>My 16 years of experience of automation projects are brought to bear on clients' tough system
integration problems. Document tracking, material control, voice infrastructure, database servers and
more&mdash;I write up the specification, define the budget, manage the risks
and issues, and hand systems over to delighted users.
</p>

<h2>Project Management Subject Group</h2>

<p>Believe it or not, I learned the core disciplines of both project management
and automation in the
chemical engineering profession.  I still use the seminars and publications of
<a href="http://pmsg.icheme.org/">Project Management Subject
Group</a> of the IChemE as a key part of my professional development.  So I
attempt to contribute as a committee member, looking after the budget and
occasionally updating the website.  If you are or will be a project
manager, please consider joining our 300-strong
group and its committee.
